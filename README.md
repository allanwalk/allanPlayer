There are two view in this app.

First view is demo how to play local video which is put in project at first.  You can switch video by button at the top.

Second view is demo for rtsp stream. I have set up a stream by url and you can input your own url to try . Here is another sample url you can try. "http://streams.videolan.org/streams/mp4/Mr_MrsSmith-h264_aac.mp4" It is from VLC official  sample.
